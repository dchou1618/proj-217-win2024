This project, **Batch Stationary Distribution Estimation**, provides an implementation and exploration of queueing models and stationary distribution estimation using Python.

It includes:

- Scripts for estimating stationary distributions and simulation (`queueing.py`, `estimate_stationary_dist.py`)  
- A model of queuing and visits per minute (VPM) analysis (`vpm.py`)  
- Supporting documentation for usage and analysis
